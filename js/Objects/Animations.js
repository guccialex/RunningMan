    this.

  }

  //I



  //this returns a mesh of the object
  getanimation(){


  }



  //there are like 20 different shapes

  //like different skins for each shapes

  //different animations for each shapes

  //different attacks for each shapes




  //charachters
  /*

  shark
  wolf
  bear
  farmer
  fox
  witch
  Slime
  pirate


  TOO MANY

  HOW CAN I STREAMLINE THE CREATION AND GET THE ANIMATIONS AND ACTIONS
  ASTHETIC IS STUPIDLY IMPORTANT HERE

  MAYBE FOCUS ON THE BASICS AND THEN I CAN WORK FROM THERE


  Farmer
  Peasant
  Hunter
  Wolves and feral animals
  Knight
